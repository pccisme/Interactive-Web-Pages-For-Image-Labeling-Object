# Interactive-Web-Pages-For-Image-Labeling-Object

Course: INF 385T Crowdsourcing CPU Vision

## Description

In this project, I work on a webpage to allow any crowdsourcing workers to label the object in the image.

Creating the dataset is the most important part of the research of Computer Vision. We may need help from crowdsourcing workers, but we want to have a dataset with high quality. Thus, creating a good platform to collect data is essential.

In the first part of the webpage, I give the step-by-step instructions and also positive and negative examples. And the workers can label the image by clicking on its checkbox. Then, the worker can send the comment before they submit. If the workers notice any issues, they can write comments to point out the problem for us.

## Images

The images used in this project/webpage are taken by myself on a trip to Kyoto and Osaka.
